# RealDash-CAN-MQTT-Node-Red-2-way
A Node-Red flow to convert data between RealDash CAN format and MQTT

# Why did I create this?
I was looking for a way to use cheap, readily available ESP8266 boards and firmware to transmit engine sensor data to RealDash.  I own an antique vehicle that does not have OBD-II or an ECU to plug into.  This is one way to solve the problem of getting sensor data from a classic car engine into a modern digital dashboard.

Since all of the available open-source firmware for ESP8266 seems to understand MQTT, I chose to write a translator using Node-Red.
